# Zen Mode Test

This is a test file to demonstrate the zen mode functionality.

## Short line
This is short.

## Medium length line
This line has moderate length and should be centered nicely.

## Long line that might wrap
This is a much longer line of text that demonstrates how the center justification works with longer content that might approach the width limits of the terminal display.

## List items
- First item
- Second item  
- Third item with more text

## Code block
```bash
echo "This should not be centered"
ls -la
```

Back to regular text that should be centered.
